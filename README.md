# Portfolio
A general portfolio of projects completed throughout my school semester at the college of Stony Brook University. Languages used so far are that of C, Java, and MIPS.

1) BACON Encryption
       - A small encryption scheme that follows the bacon cypher (C)
2) Binary and Bitwise
       - Small and simple tests of changing numbers using bitwise operators, with one of them converting numbers into IEEE format (C)
3) CommandLine Arguments
        - Usage of command line arguments in C with usage of pointers to then use a simple search and replace through files (NOTE: Final function still bugged a bit)
4) Libraray Manager
         - A user input scheme that manages through data structures a library, with queuing and dequeuing books and managing shelves and ISBN numbers alongside with book dates (Java)
5) MIPS Encrpytion
         - An encryption scheme made through MIPS that has encryption through column major order and a modified NULL cipher, with usage of memory managment alongside the stack and frame pointer (MIPS)
6) MIPS Small Poker Hand
        - A small project managing command line inputs in which the end result manages poker hand detection of straight, two of a kind, and four of a kind. Encryption of said hands is unique (MIPS)
7) Matrixes
        - A project managing matrix multiplication and addition with usage of reading lines to then preform said operations using examples of structs (C)
8) People in Line
        - A user input table manager of managing lines in a concert, with usage of linked lists to do so (Java)
9) Person Managers
         - A user input table manager that keeps track a table of people, with uses of adding them or reading from a csv file (Java)
